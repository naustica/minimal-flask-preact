This repo contains a minimalistic template for creating a full-stack web application with Flask and Preact.

## üî• Features

- [Preact 10.x](https://preactjs.com/)
- [Flask 1.1.x](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
- [Typescript 3.9.x](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Webpack 4.x](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Jest 26.x](https://jestjs.io/)

## üíÅ Getting Started
First you will need to clone this repository. This can be done with the following command.

```bash
npm install minimal-flask-preact
```

After downloading, change your directory to minimal-flask-preact and install all dependencies.

```bash
minimal-flask-preact create my-project
cd my-project && npm install
```

## üöÄ Frontend
You can start the webpack development server with this command.
```bash
npm run dev
```

To create a javascript bundle file for production use the provided script `build`.
```bash
npm run build
```

## ü§ñ Backend
It is a good practice to create a virtual environment when working on the backend. You can create an environment in Python with `python -m venv {name}`.

A Flask app rely on some environment variables which must be set in order to safely deploy the application on a public server then.

```bash
cd server
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
export SECRET_KEY=XXX
export APP_SETTINGS=config.DevelopementConfig
```

To start the Flask server call `server.py`.
```bash
python server.py
```
